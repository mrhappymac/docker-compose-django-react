# Django & React application

This is a starter project for my Django/react applications with many starting features that are common throughtout most of my projects.


## Feature List
##### Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Custom User Model
- Django Rest Auth for authentication

##### React
- redux for state management
- react-router for app routing
- session endpoints taken care of
- react-toastify for notifications
- modals using redux


## Running

1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`
1. There should now be two servers running:
  - [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) is the Django app
  - [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) is the React app

## Using `docker-compose run` to issue one-off commands

If you want to run a one-off command, like installing dependencies, you can use the `docker-compose run <service_name> <cmd>`.

For example, to install a Javascript dependency and save that information to `package.json` we could run:
`docker-compose run --rm frontend npm install --save axios`

If you want to be on a shell for one of the Docker services, you can do something like:
`docker-compose run --rm frontend bash`
